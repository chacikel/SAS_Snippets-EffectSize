This file was developed to simplify the calculation of the effect size. Please download the raw data for an example. If you need to calculate your own data, you can replicate this data or create a file like "datahor" that contains the following variables.

// /* INPUT:datahor / / NTRT: Sample size of treatment group / / NPLC: Sample size of placebo group / / MeanTrt: Mean of treatment group / / MeanPlc: Mean of placebo group / / StdTrt: Standard deviation of treatment group / / StdPlc: Standard deviation of placebo group / / */ //
